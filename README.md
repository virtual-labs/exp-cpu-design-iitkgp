### About the Experiment 

Objective of CPU Design:

Our main objective for this experiment is to show the basic top level functionality, organization and architecture of a computer.This top level structure and function of a basic computer is important because of its explanatory power in understanding the nature of a computer. A grasp on these basic structure and functionality will provide insight into system bottolnecks, alternative pathways. Because in many cases, requirement of greater system power and fail-safe capabilities are achieved by changing the system design rather than changing the speed and reliability of individual components. So we have designed a single instruction CPU which contains a controller. A working memory has been given to examine the behavior of the CPU. The memory will contain the program in binary format which will be executed by the CPU. Through this, students can observe the behavior of a basic CPU and as well as a computer. The I/O modules have not been included in the system for the purpose of symplicity.
